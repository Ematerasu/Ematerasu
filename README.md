## Hi, I'm Dominik (or Ematerasu)

Software Engineer focused on building game engines, AI agents, and simulation-heavy systems.
Currently working on cross-language AI infrastructure and game AI research.

## Flagship Project: Scripts of Tribute

A full forward-model Tales of Tribute environment with game engine and AI integration designed for:
- AI research and self-play
- cross-language bot integration (C#, Python, gRPC)
- large-scale simulation & logging

Repos:
- [Core Engine (C#)](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core)
- [GUI (Unity)](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-GUI-2.0)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Python)

## Other Things I Build
### AI & Simulation
- Reinforcement Learning agents (PPO, custom encoders)
- Simulation & replay pipelines for ML datasets
- Tooling for AI debugging and visualization
- Experimental game mechanics (RTwP combat, tactical AI)

### Performance & Systems
- High-throughput simulation pipelines
- Efficient data structures for state-heavy systems
- Concurrency patterns for producer–consumer workloads

I’m particularly interested in optimal data structures and concurrency patterns used in
high-throughput systems and game simulations.

## Game Development (Personal Projects)
Privately, I explore game development and engine design:
- custom game logic engines
- AI-driven gameplay systems
- real-time with pause (RTwP) combat mechanics

## Generalist by Curiosity
I enjoy learning across domains — from backend systems and concurrency to AI, simulations, and game mechanics — and connecting ideas between them into coherent systems.
